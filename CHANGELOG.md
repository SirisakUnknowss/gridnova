# Changelog

## 1.0.2 — 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **Daily Puzzle**: scores now submit to the leaderboard and rewards are granted
  (root cause: server `TIME_MISMATCH` 403 when a game was paused or resumed —
  client now reports an effective `started_at` that matches actual play time).
- **Undo**: no longer refunds a lost heart (was a no-lose exploit).
- **Achievements**: "First Win" / "First Daily" now unlock
  (`check_and_grant_achievements` had no branch for them).

### Added
- Home screen shows the app version (and a STAGING badge on staging builds).

## 1.0.1
- Force SW cache bust; earlier fixes.
